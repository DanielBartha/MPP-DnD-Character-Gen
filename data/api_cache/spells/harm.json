{"higher_level":[],"index":"harm","name":"Harm","desc":["You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."],"range":"60 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":false,"duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":6,"damage":{"damage_type":{"index":"necrotic","name":"Necrotic","url":"/api/2014/damage-types/necrotic"},"damage_at_slot_level":{"6":"14d6"}},"dc":{"dc_type":{"index":"con","name":"CON","url":"/api/2014/ability-scores/con"},"dc_success":"half"},"school":{"index":"necromancy","name":"Necromancy","url":"/api/2014/magic-schools/necromancy"},"classes":[{"index":"cleric","name":"Cleric","url":"/api/2014/classes/cleric"}],"subclasses":[],"url":"/api/2014/spells/harm","updated_at":"2025-04-08T21:14:16.147Z"}
