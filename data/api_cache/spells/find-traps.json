{"higher_level":[],"index":"find-traps","name":"Find Traps","desc":["You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.","This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense."],"range":"120 feet","components":["V","S"],"ritual":false,"duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":false,"casting_time":"1 action","level":2,"school":{"index":"divination","name":"Divination","url":"/api/2014/magic-schools/divination"},"classes":[{"index":"cleric","name":"Cleric","url":"/api/2014/classes/cleric"},{"index":"druid","name":"Druid","url":"/api/2014/classes/druid"},{"index":"ranger","name":"Ranger","url":"/api/2014/classes/ranger"}],"subclasses":[{"index":"lore","name":"Lore","url":"/api/2014/subclasses/lore"}],"url":"/api/2014/spells/find-traps","updated_at":"2025-04-08T21:14:16.147Z"}
